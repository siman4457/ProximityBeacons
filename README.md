Estimote Proximity aims to provide a simple way for apps to react to physical context by reading signals from Estimote Beacons (https://estimote.com/products/). It uses Core Bluetooth and Core Location frameworks to provide the best beacon-based experience possible.

The data collected from these beacons will be used to better understand challenges in capturing and analyzing human signals. It has applications to psychophysiological well-being, personalized health, security, and human assistive agents. The purpose of this study is to analyze and understand the effects that different indoor conditions have on an individualâ€™s ability to remain productive.
